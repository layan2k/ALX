            With the release of the Iphone 12 last year, Apple saw themselves toping their rivals in last years Q4 sells.<br>
             Rumors have sparked that Apple is planning to release in the coming months. The main question is this going to be gold for Apple?

          <p>Can AI Be Trusted?</p>
          <p>
            AI(Artificial Intelligence) generalised as Machine Learning in the World Of Tech has evolved in the past few years and it will continue to evolve.<br>
            People are very opinionated about the issue whether it is safe to continue further devlopment. I myself support its development although knowing the risks it imposes to Humankind.<br>
            AI so far has made a huge impact on our lives although most don't notice it form making market predictions, risk analysis and many more we even use it for personal use nowadays.<br>
            By personal use I mean the like of Google Now, Alexa, Cortana and even Jarvis. Yeah Jarvis is real only that its fully copy writed to Marvel studios. There are several videos out there on how to make Jarvis using Python<br>
            To conclude this post AI is a huge deal and its future is a bigdeal only if the right rules are implemented.

          <p>Lets Start </p>
          <p>
            Well I recently started my programming career and So far I have experienced a whole lot of ups and down. Let me be honest coding can be boring especially when you're a beginner.<br>
            When starting your programming career make sure you understand the basics like Data structures of the language and basic Algorithms. Don't spend too much time focusing on the basics<br>
            instead focus on developing your skills with beginner project and increase challenges as you go. Secondly don't expect to start build what you want like write there, plan on what you intend to do<br>
            and focus on the main goal. The other recommendation I would make is getting blue filter glasses to avoid eye strain and headaches. Bonus Tip get yourself some coffee you'll be shocked with the amount <br>
            concentration boost it can give but do abide by the measures written the cofee product.
